# Gameplay Concepts [concepts]

This subfolder defines various concepts of gameplay, many of which have REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED semantics. 
These concepts build the basis of gameplay on the Gac14 Server, and are expanded upon in detail in [/commands](https://chorman0773.github.io/Gac14-Datapack/commands) and [/datapack](https://chorman0773.github.io/Gac14-Datapack/datapack).
