# Command Context [cmd.ctx]

The Command Context refers to the set of permissions (among other things), which apply to a particular command being run. 

There are 3 kinds of command contexts:
1. A Restricted Context, where a specific set of permissions apply
2. A Normal Context, where permissions are extrapolated from certain runtime variables
3. An Elevated Context, where all permissions apply
