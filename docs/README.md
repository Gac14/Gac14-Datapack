# Gac14 Specification

The following subfolders define the specification for the execution of the Gac14 Datapack. 

Various special terminology will be used within the Gac14 Specification. This terminology is defined [here](https://chorman0773.github.io/Gac14-Datapack/Terminology).

## Gac14 Datapack
The Gac14 Datapack is a datapack provided by Gac14 which provides a configuration point for users, and can be deployed on Complete Implementations of the Gac14 Specification. 
Deploying the Gac14 Datapack on a Partial Implementation is Conditionally Supported. 
The behavior of the Gac14 Datapack when deployed in a context which does not implement the Gac14 Specification is undefined. 

## Partial Implementation

A partial implementation is some sort of Minecraft Standalone or Game modification or collection or combination therein, which provides part of the Gac14 Specification, and clearly documents which parts it provides. 

Combining multiple Partial Implementations from different providers is Conditionally supported. If Unsupported, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise how the partial implementations interact is implementation-defined. 

## Complete Implementation

A Complete Implementation is a partial implementation which documents all parts of the Gac14 Specification as provided. 
The behavior of a complete implementation when combined with other complete implementations or partial implementations is undefined.
