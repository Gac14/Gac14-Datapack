# Multiserver Interconnect Protocol [mutlisrv.interconnect]

## PkmCom - Normative References 
As Part of the PokemonSMS Public Specification, Connor Horman released a set of documentation describing an Abstract Communications Protocol that is defined to be agnostic of the underlying Transmission Protocol (called the "Base Protocol").

This document references the PkmCom Abstract Protocol, as well as the PkmCom Dynamic Shared State Extensions.

The Abstract Protocol can be found [here](https://chorman0773.github.io/PkmCom-APL-Library/AbstractProtocol.md) and the DSS Protocol can be found [here](https://chorman0773.github.io/PkmCom-APL-Library/DynamicSharedState.md).
