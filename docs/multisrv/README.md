# Multi Server Environments [multisrv]

This folder defines a set of optional extensions to the Gac14 Specification which apply in environments which an implementation of Gac14 Specification may be operated in tandom with another implementation of the Gac14 Specification. This allows these implementations to communicate between each other, and share state.

Additionally, other entities on the network may also operate with these extensions disjoint from the rest of the specification, providing additional functionality either specified here or distinct from this specification.
