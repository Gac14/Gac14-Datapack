# Gac14-Datapack
Datapack for Gac14

(c) 2018-2019 Connor Horman and Gac14 Team

This datapack is designed to implement many of the features of Gac14 in a structured manner. 
This Datapack is designed for use with the Gac14 Modification Set as created by Connor Horman. 
It will only function correctly on a minecraft version modified with those mods or with annother single mod or collection of mods which successfully implement the Gac14 Server, defined by the `/docs` directory.

This Repository has "plug-and-play" functionality. It can be downloaded or cloned to any Minecraft Save or Server Directory which is run with a version of minecraft modified as above. 
If utilized in a Minecraft Version Prior to 1.13, additional features which are not documented will have to be implemented by any modifications for this datapack to work. 

This datapack supports automatic updates. If cloned to the server directory of any supporting server, updates to the repository will be reflected in-game within an implementation-defined period of time.

This repository is released under the Terms of the MIT Free Software License. See the corresponding `LICENSE` file for details. 

Additionally, complete and correct implementations of the Gac14 Server are granted to the following additional License:

Permission is hereby implicitly granted to any person or persons who creates, maintains, and/or modifies a complete and correct implementation of the Gac14 Server, to use, without restriction, any patent which covers in part or in whole the functionality of the Gac14 Server, which exists presently or will exist, for as long as that patent exists and is held by either Connor Horman or the Gac14 Team, solely for use in that or other complete and correct implementations.
