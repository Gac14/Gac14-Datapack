# Gac14-Datapack
Datapack for Gac14

This datapack is designed to implement many of the features of Gac14 in a structured manner. 
This Datapack is designed for use with the Gac14 Modification Set as created by Connor Horman. 
It will only function correctly on a minecraft version modified with those mods or with annother single mod or collection of mods which successfully implement the Gac14 Server, defined by the `/docs` directory.

This Repository has "plug-and-play" functionality. It can be downloaded or cloned to any Minecraft Save or Server Directory which is run with a version of minecraft modified as above. 
If utilized in a Minecraft Version Prior to 1.13, additional features which are not documented will have to be implemented by any modifications for this datapack to work.
